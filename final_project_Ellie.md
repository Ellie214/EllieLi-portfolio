# This is Part 1 of my final project.
## Topic: Population aging 

### Outline
For my final project, I would like to utilize data visualization to tell a story about the global population aging, and how it impacts policy maker and future designers.

My story arc starts off with an introduction and overview of the project: what is population aging and how it occurs. Then my story builds up to identifying the problem of population aging, why it is imperative to not only the U.S., but globally. Then it gradually reaches the climax to what impact are made by this issue, across countries, as well as demonstrating some policies that combat such challenge. Then it fades into hope, projection, and solutions for future designs, including societal, arts and environmental aspects.
