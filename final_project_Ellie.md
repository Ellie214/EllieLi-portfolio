# This is Part 1 of my final project.
## Topic: Population aging 

### Outline
For my final project, I would like to utilize data visualization to tell a story about the global population aging, and how it impacts policy maker and future designers. 

![test image](/storyarc.jpg)

My story arc starts off with an introduction and overview of the project: what is population aging and how it occurs. Then my story builds up to identifying the problem of population aging, why it is imperative to not only the U.S., but globally. Then it gradually reaches the climax to what impact are made by this issue, across countries, as well as demonstrating some policies that combat such challenge. Then it fades into hope, projection, and solutions for future designs, including societal, arts and environmental aspects. 

Structure of my project will look like the following:

*Introduction and Background*

This is an overview of the project.

*How it changed over the years*

This section I will have a range of data visualization to depict the change in population demographic in American over the years. I will also compare the means of age over different countries. 

*Impacts*

In this section, I will dive into several significant impact caused by population aging, including its influence on the arts, society, economy, and politics. 

*Policy around the Globe*

In this section, I will primarily focus on Japan and Singapore who are the first countries that suffer from population aging. They are also the countries who have come up with decent policies and solutions to adopt this demographic shift, and even benifiting from it. 

*Design Opportunities*

This is where I will demonstrate some potential opportunities that goes hand in hand with the policies I talk about in the above section. 

*Call to Action*

This last part is call to action where I urge the audience to take action and perhaps to realize the shift in demographic and the ways it impact our lives. For designers and practitioners in the arts and public policy industry, thinking of how our future designs of programs will be influenced is important and deserves attention.

### The Data

The first two datasets are found and dowloaded from Statista using CMU's account.

Dataset 1: [Share of Population older than 65 in the Asia Pacific region in 2035](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100149/apac-aging-population-forecast-by-country/), original souce: United Nation.

Dataset 2: [Share of old age population in the total U.S. population from 1950 to 2050](https://www.statista.com/statistics/457822/share-of-old-age-population-in-the-total-us-population/), original source: ChildStats.gov and Census Bureau

Dataset 3: [Elderly population](https://data.oecd.org/pop/elderly-population.htm#indicator-chart), from OECD.

I will combine the three datasets and make two data visualization. The first one is to compare across the countries' the population distribution by age groups as a stack bar chart. The year will be 2035, which I aim to create a story of a projected future demogrpahic makeup by age. 

The second graph is a line graph. I will take out the % of population above age 65 in each country in from 1980 to 2035, and demonstrate a visualization of how each country's elderly population change over time. I will highlight the global average and this will show how the countries perform against each other.

Dataset 3: [Age Distribution of the Population, 1950-2060](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2015/10/09/t2_age_distribution.pdf), from Urban Institute Program on Retirement Policy, which based on the calculation from Census Bureau. I also downloaded tables of population by age and sex from Census Bureau as reference. The lastest projection Census did was in 2017, [link here](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popproj/2017-summary-tables.html). 

This dataset will be used to make several bar charts like a population age pyramid, and the shapes of the bar shart visualizes the shift in demographic of population by age in the U.S., from history to present, then to the future.

Dataset 4: [Working age population, by country](https://data.oecd.org/pop/working-age-population.htm), from OECD.

This dataset helps the audience to visualize how an aging population would potentially impact the working force over time. I will highlight Japan, and introduce how Japan faces this challenge.

I am also thinking of how to visualize the design opportunities, but the visuals may be more of a flow chart.


### Method and Medium

For this project, I would like to use Shorthand. However, I have never used a platform like Shorthand which involves HTML. So I plan to take some time to learn HTML and the coding so the process will go smoothly when I prepare for my final project. I may first draft out the entire project, especially the text portion, on a separate document as a normal research paper, and then create the visualization using Tableau and Flourish. Then I will put them together into Shorthand, and see if I can make some the webpage more interactive which its layouts and design. I plan to add some scrolling or animation to the part where I present the age pyramid oevr years, but I will play around with it. Additionally, I want to create some images to better visualize the policis and solution that Japan and Singapore did, which make the project more attractive and persuasive. However, I will see how I can illustrate them in a aesthetically appealing way when there's not a heavy data involved. Lastly, I will try to use creative ways to make the project more interesting and relatable to the audience.
