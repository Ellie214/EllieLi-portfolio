# This is Part 1 of my final project.
## Topic: Population aging 

### Outline
For my final project, I would like to utilize data visualization to tell a story about the global population aging, and how it impacts policy maker and future designers.

My story arc starts off with an introduction and overview of the project: what is population aging and how it occurs. Then my story builds up to identifying the problem of population aging, why it is imperative to not only the U.S., but globally. Then it gradually reaches the climax to what impact are made by this issue, across countries, as well as demonstrating some policies that combat such challenge. Then it fades into hope, projection, and solutions for future designs, including societal, arts and environmental aspects. 

*Introduction and Background*

This is an overview of the project.

*How it changed over the years*

This section I will have a range of data visualization to depict the change in population demographic in American over the years. I will also compare the means of age over different countries. 

*Impacts*

In this section, I will dive into several significant impact caused by population aging, including its influence on the arts, society, economy, and politics. 

*Policy around the Globe*

In this section, I will primarily focus on Japan and Singapore who are the first countries that suffer from population aging. They are also the countries who have come up with decent policies and solutions to adopt this demographic shift, and even benifiting from it. 

*Design Opportunities*

This is where I will demonstrate some potential opportunities that goes hand in hand with the policies I talk about in the above section. 

*Call to Action*

This last part is call to action where I urge the audience to take action and perhaps to realize the shift in demographic and the ways it impact our lives. For designers and practitioners in the arts and public policy industry, thinking of how our future designs of programs will be influenced is important and deserves attention.
