## Summary
I chose this data visualization because it is very helpful for me in my future career. It is from the organization that I interned with, so I have a better sense of the narrative story and the data is publicly accessible. Even I was not in charge of this project, I helped with compling the data under the instruction of my supervisor, which also benefits my redesign of the visualization. Acknowledging that the organization is a B2B platform, many of our readers are professionals and practitioners in cultural, art and museum industries who are interested in Chinese visitors. This indicated that they have some basic knowlegde of WeChat and how the articles are important factors when communicating and incentivizing Chinese consumers. As a result, I did not expain too much of this on the graph, and the "average pageview per article" would be a reasonable measurement or indicator of the institution's performance on WeChat. 

The original visualization is logic and intuitive. It is not misleading in anyway, but it lacks emphasis and the comparison is not quite useful. From my perspective, it is more beneficial for audience if the graph visualizes the performance across time(month), and both Western and Chinese institutions are compared in the same graph. Currently, Western and Chinese institutions are separated into two similar structured graphs, which did not make sense to me because part of the reason why this index exists is to compare the performance of both Western and Chinese cultural institution. Therefore, the audience would have a sense of how a particular organization fits in the whole picture, and why there is a peak(this complements with the text analysis of the Index report). In terms of emotive, the original graph is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but the compliation is a little distracting because there is no key point to look at. It also does not engage people to learn more and want to share the data with others. Based on the critique, I decided to combine the two graphs into one, and use different colors and highlights so the visualization is more useful and engaging well remains intuitive and accurate.

My initial thought is to recreate another bar chart which combines both catogories(Western and Chinese) together into one. I showed my sketches to two of my friends and got some feedback. Cecilia, who is not in the art field but majored in Statistic told me that the bar chart is a little consufing and did not carry out the message straightforward, but after reading the context, she understands better what the chart is telling. This made me think that my initial sketch did not stand alone well without paragraph texts supporting it, which is not effective. Then I asked some feedback from Catherine, my previous intern colleague who works in a museum. She told me that the information was useful, but the comparison was not strong enough if it was only between two months. She also pointed out a bar chart took up a lot of space, making it seemed to be a long and tedious visualization without "fun to watch". I appreciate her thoughts and her urge for creativeness since the target audience are mostly art people and storytellers who favor creative and interactive visualization. As a result, I used The Wizard to explore some potential chart types that I could use, and combining some tips from the Good Charts Workbook, I decided to redesign my graph using a slop chart. It can show the timeline and how the instituitions are doing across the time horizontally and the lines in a graph is effective for comparison. Becuase the selected institutions have changed when the project passed on to me as an Intern, the first month in my graph only starts from July. The project is somehow discontinued since October, so the relevant dataset I used only consists of three months, but potentially this could be updated each month. When choosing color, I decided to avoid red, blue, and green because I don't want to cause problems to color blindess people and I have no intention of associating any of these with political backgrounds. Therefore, I chose two colors that are contradicting, and aligning with the overall theme of the website(the color scheme has been used in the cover photo and in some other Jing Group(the website organization) brand cover images as well. The fact that one institution is a outlier that has particular large pageviews made to change the y-axis into log measurements, just to maintain a better looking. Otherwise, all the other lines(slopes) will be crammed together.
