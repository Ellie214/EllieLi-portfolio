# Part II: WIREFRAME & USER RESEARCH 

## Wireframe/storyboard

I chose to use Balsamiq to make a wireframe of the final website.

The data visualizations are sketched as the followings(Sorry because I failed to insert them into the wireframe):


## User Research

The target audience for this project is designers and policy makers. I have interviewed three individuals(A,B,C). Person A is a graduate student, age 24, who studies statistics. Person B is another graduate student who studies public policy. Person C is a pastor and does part time land mowing, age 45, has two children.

*Question 1: Do you know that there is a demographic shift in our population(U.S.)?*

Answer from A: Yes, I've heard of "aging population" but don't know the specifics.

Answer from B: Yes. I am pretty familiar with this topic.

Answer from C: Sort of, not too sure.

*Question 2: Is the wireframe clear enough? Anything confusing?*

Answer from A: A little confusing, or maybe it's becuase it's only a draft. I would like to see more visuals though, and perhaps some more interations with the audience?

Answer from B: Yes. I have read several articles on the issue before, but only in terms of policies like healthcare services, social securities, etc. It's interesting to see the design opportunities, but it would be better to make a stronger connection.

Answer from C: The wireframe is easy to follow through. I don't feel related that much since I am not designers but some of the impacts are substaintial. I would be hoping that our country is doing something to benefit from it, though, I am getting old too, haha. 

*Question 3: Are the visualizations make sense or help you understand the content?*

Answer from A: Yes. I really like the comparision bar chart where you can clearly visualize the change over time. I did not know what the population distribution was like back in the 80s, so it's a great visual, at least more powerful than a piece of text describing the change.

Answer from B: I like how you make the tabs so we can potentially click on the year to see the graph accordingly. The visualizations are helpful in terms of understanding the issue, but I hope to see more visuals under the design opportunities and impacts part.

Answer from C: It took me some time to read the stacked bar chart, and I don't know why you compare the distribution across countries. Do you want to emphasize that this is a global issue, not only the something happens in the States? Other than that, cool charts.

*Question 4: Is this something you would like to read if I don't ask you to do so for this interview?*

Answer from A: Probably not if it's something unrelated to my current research, sorry.

Answer from B: It depends. I already know the issue, so I may not spend more time on this. It's not new information.

Answer from C: Yeah, most likely. It's something that would brings my attention.


### Key Findings and Plans on Changing

**1. The presentation is lack of interactions and interest to target audience.**

Plans: a) Add some interaction part to the impact part, something like a future scenario case to demonstrate how our future would be like with aging population;
b) Change the first cloud word graph using a shape of an old couple;
c) Demonstrate a clear heading, especially the title, and change it to "Aging population: design future" to better emphasize the design opportunity aspect.

**2. The data visualizations are not strong/diverse enough.**

Plans: a)
