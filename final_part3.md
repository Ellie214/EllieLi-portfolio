# Final Project Part 3 (Behind the scene)

(For how I came up with the project and the user test/research, please check Part1 and Part2)

## Data Story

Since the completion of Part 2, I did not change too much of my structure but only moving some parts around. Due to technological issues, I redesigned some of the pages of my final deliverables to adjust Shorthand, so it might look somewhat different from the wireframe I projected before. I have incorporated a diagram featuring the scrollmation of Shortand, trying to add some interaction and audience engagement according to the feedback given by some of the interviewers. Adding a treemap instead of having multiple visualizations demonstrating similar problem(aging distribution) is a more effective change I have made. The treemap suggested why I chose to demonstrate Japan and Singapore as examples as well as showing the hierarchy. This is more distinctive and straightforward than the stacked bar chart I planned originally. I have also finalized and narrowed my audience to designers. The story combines future thinking and design thinking, specifically tackling the issue of an aging population. 

Additionally, I had more time to play with Tableau so I was able to create a much better and interactive visualization than I imagined. I included features like filter and pages so the population pyramid was presented in a unique way. Users could filter to highlight certain age groups as they wish, and if you press the "play" button, it automatically animated from the first year(2020) to the last year(2060) so audience have a better knowledge to see the paradigm shift of population distribution.
