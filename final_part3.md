## Data Story

Since the completion of Part 2, I did not change too much of my structure but only moving some parts around. Due to technological issues, I redesigned some of the pages of my final deliverables to adjust Shorthand, so it might look somewhat different from the wireframe I projected before. I have incorporated a diagram featuring the scrollmation of Shortand, trying to add some interaction and audience engagement according to the feedback given by some of the interviewers. Adding a treemap instead of having multiple visualizations demonstrating similar problem(aging distribution) is a more effective change I have made. The treemap suggested why I chose to demonstrate Japan and Singapore as examples as well as showing the hierarchy. This is more distinctive and straightforward than the stacked bar chart I planned originally. I also removed the word cloud because it doesn't fit the overal theme and aesthetic, and it was not necessarily to be included. Finally, I have finalized and narrowed my audience to designers. The story combines future thinking and design thinking, specifically tackling the issue of an aging population. 

Additionally, I had more time to play with Tableau so I was able to create a much better and interactive visualization than I imagined. I included features like filter and pages so the population pyramid was presented in a unique way. Users could filter to highlight certain age groups as they wish, and if you press the "play" button, it automatically animated from the first year(2020) to the last year(2060) so audience have a better knowledge to see the paradigm shift of population distribution. 

I have made sure that all visualizations used same color palette/theme throughout the entire project, utilizing all the techniques and strategies discussed in the class and in the guidebook. The Call To Action section was not clearly defined previsouly, so I worked on refining this part, which also resulted some minor adjustments in the section before. I renamed the section titles from "background" to "problem", and added some resources for inspiration under the "design opportunity" section. This is more logically presented compared to what I planned for, following the route: 

"identify problem - why is it important - literature review/case studies - opportunities - action"

I wanted to address the idea of future thinking, and the aging population is something that hasn't been appreciated enough in our society. Therefore, there's no particular action where you can click a button to help immediately, but rather acknowledging the imperative issue in future design works.
