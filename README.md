# About me
Hello, this is Ellie(she/her)! I am a Master of Arts Management Student at CMU. I am a self-motivated artist who brings nuances to life through art. My passion and support for social interaction and community building are reflected in my creative pursuits and determination of a better place for art to thrive in such a rapidly changing world. 
Some of my previous works are related to media installations, experimental and documentary films, and photography. I became interested in art history a few years ago, and had worked in museums and galleries. This summer, I did a remote internship at Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where I experienced a better learning of performing organizations. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn different ways to enhance my skills of data visualization, which is helpful for my career. I am planning to work in nonprofit arts organizations after graduation. I am also glad that I have this opportunity to learn Github because I don't usually get a change to use it. 
Coming from a background in visual arts and filmmaking, I feel like data visualization is something I need the most. I like to picture things visually, and data makes more sense in a visualizated way than mere numbers. I have come across many grpahs in reports that I read through these semesters, and I discovered how importance it is to demonstrate a proper graph. Some graphs are punctual and easy to follow, while some are pretty confusing. Therefore, I would like to use the knowledge I learned from this course, which in my mind is very practical, and apply it to my future studies and works.
