# Summary
For the third visualization, I feel like it makes more sense to develop on the original OECD chart. At first, I hesitated on which chart to choose, but I think pie/donut chart doesn't make sense becuase there is no proportional relationships in the dataset, and there's nothing adding up to a "100%". The scatter plots are also not an option because the dots represents the relationship between two variables(usually to present some kind of correlation), which apparently not what the debt-GDP ratios are for. So this left me a few choices, and I eventually decided to use the grid column charts. I chose the column becuase it suits the intention to show the ratio for each country, and the grid makes up all the years from 1995-2019. This graph is best to compare which country has higher ratio, and which country has lower ratio in the same year. Originally, I want to do a bar chart rase, but the dataset was not organized in the right way for Flourish to setup, so I gave up. This visualization ended up to be very similar to the one from OECD, except that it has a overall view of the entire period of years from 1995-2019. It is good if you want to check on the performance of certain countries in a particular year. If you want to see how a country is performed over years, then the second visualization would be the best.
